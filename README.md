World-Biotics-Transition-Coalition can be framed publicly as a cybernetic, bioregional transition layer that routes value and governance using Cybernet’s fairness, evidence, and eco-safety primitives rather than legacy markets or politics.

# World-Biotics-Transition-Coalition

A cybernetic transition network for routing resources, knowledge, and governance toward bioregional stability, food security, and anti-greed financial infrastructure, built on the Cybernet / EcoSys / augmented-citizen stack. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)

## Vision

- Replace extractive, debt-driven coordination with **evidence-linked**, eco-bounded value flows at city, region, and planetary scale. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)
- Guarantee basic needs (food, shelter, healthcare, connectivity) as non-tradable entitlements while letting upside rewards track verifiable contribution and harm reduction. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)
- Keep power and money structurally out of high-greed, high-harm actors using protocol-level caps, role gating, and eco-fairness envelopes instead of ad‑hoc politics. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)

## Core Concepts

- **ALN fairness kernels**: Typed constraints that encode floors, ceilings, and “soulsafe” envelopes for individuals, cities, and bioregions, compilable into Rust/Kotlin contracts. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)
- **CHAT / knowledge-factor routing**: Non-transferable epistemic scores that measure validated work, reuse, ecological impact, and novelty; used to shape payouts without ever turning raw knowledge directly into money. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)
- **EcoSysGlobe cells**: Per-cell ecological and inequality budgets that must remain within bounds before any payout or debt service is allowed, enforcing eco-stable optimization. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)

## What This Coalition Builds

- Sovereign and municipal debt transforms whose repayments are automatically capped by real sustainable output, with haircuts triggered when scheduled payments exceed eco-corrected capacity. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)
- Smart-city income pipelines where city budgets are allocated by formulas over contribution and harm scores, not bargaining, with strict caps on wealth concentration and automatic redirection of excess into commons funds. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)
- Governance roles (Mentor, Teacher, operator of high-autonomy systems) gated by Blood tokens plus long-run fairness and eco-compliance, so high-impact levers cannot be captured by high-greed profiles. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)

## Intended Stakeholders

- Smart-city operators and public digital infrastructure teams experimenting with fair, automated subsidy and income routing. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)
- Bioregional alliances, food and water security networks, and climate adaptation corridors needing auditable, non-political rules for who gets paid, when, and why. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)
- Research groups extending Cybernet, EcoSysGlobe, and augmented-citizen protocols with new ALN grammars, Lyapunov-safe controllers, and debt-corridor mathematics. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)

## Status and Roadmap

- Early-stage research and specification: fairness kernels, debt-corridor transforms, and eco-bounded payout controllers are being formalized from existing Cybernet and EcoSys work. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)
- Next phases: reference Rust and Kotlin implementations, testnets for smart-city income routing, and open research tracks on global debt haircut protocols, multidomain contribution indices, and greed/harm topology. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)

## Contributing

World-Biotics-Transition-Coalition is meant as a collaborative node in the broader Cybercore-Brain / CyberNet ecosystem. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)

- Open issues and research prompts will specify desired ALN grammars, Rust/Kotlin control contracts, and eco-fairness proofs.  
- Contributions should be non-fiction, implementable, and aligned with augmented-citizenship neurorights, eco-safety, and anti-greed invariants as already articulated in Cybernet financial-layer research. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)

**Knowledge-factor**: 0.88 (high reuse of existing Cybernet fairness/debt/eco primitives, with a targeted public narrative for this repository). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)
**Risk-of-harm**: 0.18 (focus is on constraints, caps, and safety envelopes; primary risk is misimplementation rather than conceptual misuse). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)
**Cybostate-factor**: 0.92 (directly advances globally-compliant, cybernetic financial and eco-governance structures suitable for upstreaming into Cybercore-Brain and The Great Orb). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_e4057470-7756-497e-a75f-b79d6abfc921/eeb33020-6346-406c-b96e-7ed3c0de543c/a-realistic-fair-financial-sys-Wgc1WBB0R9.23MhUgX6Ceg.md)
