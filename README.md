### `Eco-Sys/README.md`

> Eco-Sys is a non-fiction, policy-enforced environmental computation layer within the Virta-Sys and VSC-ARTEMIS ecosystems. It provides verified repository orchestration and energy-aware automation designed for sustainable infrastructure.

***

## About

**Eco-Sys** is an environmentally responsible monument for precision calculations across **public-transit networks**, **waterline optimization**, and **earth-restoration technologies**.  
It integrates advanced **workflow orchestrators** to minimize the energy footprint of physical hardware and machine operations — *without diminishing computational power or throughput.*

Eco-Sys acts as a **cryptographically verifiable source-of-truth layer** for **Virta-Sys** and **VSC-ARTEMIS**, ensuring each data point and commit reflects **real-world, nonfictional progress**.  
All activity in Eco-Sys is recorded within the **Typewriter** authorship framework and persisted in the **Data-Lake**, maintaining tamper-evident ownership trails and cross-system compliance.

### Foundational Alignment

- **Virta-Sys:** Virtual cluster substrate for dynamic AI orchestration.  
- **VSC-ARTEMIS:** System-brain and energy-logic orchestrator for intelligent compute routing.  
- **Eco-Sys:** Environmental and compliance layer ensuring ethical orchestration, sustainable execution, and restorative design.

## Core Capabilities

- **Repository Tracking:**  
  Automatically discover and synchronize critical repositories including `Virta-Sys`, `VSC-ARTEMIS`, `VM-Cluster-Nation`, and `Googolswarm.os`.

- **Non-Fiction Enforcement:**  
  Guarantees every process and dataset results in *tangible output* — whether code, configuration, or validation metadata.  
  No simulated, imaginary, or illustrative data is permitted.

- **Authorship & Compliance:**  
  Implements **Typewriter semantics** to log signed authorship and embed immutable evidence of ownership and contribution lineage within the Data-Lake.

- **Energy-Aware Scheduling:**  
  Leverages adaptive orchestration logic to lower physical machine power consumption while preserving 100% system capability during AI chat triggers or interactive workloads.

## Basic Usage

1. Place the configuration file at your workspace root:

   ```
   virta-git.config.json
   ```

   Ensure it aligns with your **Virta-Sys** / **VSC-ARTEMIS** anchors.

2. Validate repositories and confirm their state:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin virta-git -- \
     --config virta-git.config.json \
     --repo-root ./virta-git-repos \
     validate-latest
   ```

3. (Optional) Generate an experimental **energy utilization plan** to benchmark machine optimization:

   ```bash
   cargo run --bin virta-git -- energy-plan \
     --total-machines 8 \
     --baseline-x-mwz 1200.0 \
     --baseline-y-mwz 900.0 \
     --target-utilization 0.7
   ```
